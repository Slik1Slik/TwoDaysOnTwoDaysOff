# TwoDaysOnTwoDaysOff

Working schedule manager.

## Description

How many times have you got in a situation where you needed to make an appointment with a doctor, and you were asked if you were able to come on, say, Nov 12, and you had to stand there calculating if that would be a day-off? Probably, not so many, if you didn't work in shifts, but some people might share this pain with me.

The TwoDaysOnTwoDaysOff (2/2) app is to solve the problem. Everything you have to do is to provide the nearest shift's first date, working days and days-off count, and the app will do the rest.

## Features

  - Marking a day as an exception, e.g. sick-days or vacation;
  - Defining days colors whatever you want;
  - Automated data update each shift.
